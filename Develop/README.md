employee adder

Okay, this guy is late but it works.  I have been submitting half completed assignments so i wanted to make sure i got this one to work fully.  
My biggest struggle was understanding how to use render function, 

from what i hear a lot of students didnt even use the function but instead just incorporated html in their app.js but i knew this wasnt the spirit of the assignment so..
i edited the functions in our htmlrender.js file functions by adding a writeFile method on each "role" so now when staff array is passed into render() 
each staff member will get an html created under a file "theirname".html

attached link to video showing app!
